## TODO:
- it seems to work for any one channel image, where 0 is the background, not necessarily binary! Either force it as prepocessing of arguments, or adjust visualisation functions
- make it not stall if defaults are set to 0 (find out why it stalls)
- it doesn't add some obvious edges, find out why, and make them add (the edge to tip spheres): could it be that it is because we remove some stuff from sdf on the fly, so then the edges do not pass the criterion? No, now  I think it is because sphere overlap too much, so the big sphere can cover middle of a smaller sphere. That must be an issue with the distance itself. Maybe one can make a weight paramater there to steer it?
- makes overlap between spheres too big, is it a property of the distance or what? can it be changed? Same answer as above!
- verify input image and put some guardrails, e.g. for non-binary/non-grayscale. Depends on what SDF function accepts
- make exports to Networkx
- write tests for small functions
- better name functions and variables. Almost done!
- add more examples
- Implement the 3D version!
- Argmax for 0 array still gives one vertex, that should not be the case
